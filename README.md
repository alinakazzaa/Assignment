# Assignment
## Evaluate Importance and Priority
#### Prioritization Factors
*	[**Estimate for Your Resources,**](https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/5-tips-for-task-estimating) Different people will complete work  at different rates due to varying levels of skill, experience and confidence in their work. Work will progress faster if you assign the best people to work on tasks they know and understand. Save time on your project by using experienced resources and save on-the-job learning and mentoring for another time.
*	[**Cost of developing requirements,**](https://www.teamgantt.com/guide-to-project-management/how-to-estimate-projects) An essential factor to be considered by the product owner. Value and cost together indicate the Return on Investment (RoI) for the requirements.
*	Amount and **significance of functionality** that will be gained while working on the requirements.
*	Understanding the **level of risks** involved in introducing the new features.

#### Prioritization Techniques
Follow the _**relative weighting scheme**_ when trying to prioritise any task. It is a simple model where prioritization is done based on all the factors of the task. Major factors to be considered when weighing prioritization are:
*	The **value of the feature** and the negative impact that might be caused by the absence of the feature
*	Based on the collective judgment from product owner and the development team, a weight is assigned to each feature in the following way (a scoreboard from 1 to 9 is usually used)
     * Benefit from having the feature 
     * Loss for not having the feature 
     * Cost of producing the feature 
     * The risk incurred in producing the feature
     * The priority and rank are then determined by dividing the value score as below: 
     * (Benefit score + Penalty score) / (Cost score + Risk score)
