## **Task Estimation**

### **Work Breakdown Structures**

**WBS** (Work Breakdown Structure) describes what tasks need to be completed in a project. However, it does not include factors such as timelines or resources. The goal of the WBS is to focus the team on what has to be done.

When you're breaking down what has to be done it is important to remove verbs from each level. You are not describing the tasks necessary to complete what has to be done, you are just describing them. Find out more [here](https://www.guru99.com/an-expert-view-on-test-estimation.html )


Some of the benefits of WBS include:
*   **Project Schedule:** Once you define all the tasks required to complete the project, as well as their hierarchical relationships, it will be much easier to assign resources and set deadlines.
*   **Accountability:** Since all elements in a WBS are mutually exclusive, it helps create accountability. A team assigned to a single work package is solely accountable for its completion. This reduces overlaps in responsibility.
*   **Commitment:** The WBS gives teams a very high-level overview of their responsibilities. Since each team is responsible for a specific component at a time, it helps make them more committed to completing their assigned tasks.
*   **Reduces ambiguities:** WBS involves the project manager, team members and relevant stakeholders. This encourages dialog and so everyone knows exactly what they have to do. This way there is ambiguity.

## Coding Standards

It is important to realise that your programming choices will reflect the quality
of your code and impact the productivity levels of your colleagues. Multidots - an agency specialising in web development for content publishers [coding standards guideline](https://www.multidots.com/importance-of-code-quality-and-coding-standard-in-software-development/) highlights the importance of code quality and coding standards for improving efficiency, minimising risk of project failure, reducing complexity and simplifying debugging processes.

### General Programming Practices

#### Naming Conventions

* Use meaningful variable names throughout your code
* Maintain a consistent naming style for classes, functions and files
* Names should be explanatory of the object or the functionality of the methods that carry them. 

#### Formatting and Layout

To work together as a team, it is important that each developer effectively formats code,  tools and ensures code is well-segmented and easy to read. 

* Use auto-lint provided by the development environment your team is using
* Use block separation to make files more readable

For all programming languages refer to general [guidelines](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/code-quality/coding-style/index.html) for coding and formatting styles recommended by the Firefox development team.

### Developement Style

**Reusability**

It is encouraged to become familiar with reusable coding patterns and apply them in all development stages throughout projects. It will
* Reduce the amount of code we have to write
* Increase in team efficiency
* Allow us to maximise resources and development times

Refer to [Perforce's Code Reuse Strategy](https://www.perforce.com/blog/qac/challenge-code-reuse-and-how-reuse-code-effectively) for further recommendations on the best practices to apply. 

**Component driven**

Component driven development is one of the best patterns for code reusability. 

It ensures

* Consistency for both front end and back end
* Less code, which also means less debugging

Further information about component-based development patterns can be found on [Jack Pritchard's CDD Insights Article](https://whatjackhasmade.co.uk/component-driven-development). 


**Refactoring**

Overly complex structures and unnecessary code can be avoided by effective refactoring practices which should be done by all developers before code review. 

*Consider*

* Project structure that will shape the file structure choices
* Single task functions to simplify code and encourage code reusability
* Parameters and how to make the best use without over-parameterising methods

*Avoid*

* Long classes - split into more classes
* Overly-nested and long functions
* Long parameter lists
