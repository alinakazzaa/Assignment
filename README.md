# Handbook for Best Coding Practices

## Coding Standards

### General Programming Practices

It is important to realise that your programming choices will reflect the quality
of your code and impact the productivity levels of your colleagues. Multidots - an agency specialising in web development for content publishers [coding standards](https://www.multidots.com/importance-of-code-quality-and-coding-standard-in-software-development/) highlights the importance of code quality and coding standards to improve efficiency, minimises the risk of project failure, reduces complexity and makes debugging easier.

Multidote coding standards 

The following guidelines are recommended to be used as best coding practices when 
working on developement projects:

#### Naming Conventions

Use meaningful variable names throughout your code. Maintain a consistent naming style for classes, functions and files. Names should be explanatory of the object or the functionality of the methods that carry them. 

#### Formatting and Layout

Code formatting and layout
Code segmentation & indentation for readabilit

#### Developement Style

Avoid over-complex structures and files
Avoid deep-nested structures and large files. Split large files and functions into smaller components. 
Focus on reusable components and functions

For all programming languages refer to general [guidelines](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/code-quality/coding-style/index.html) for coding and formatting style recommended by the Firefox developement team.
