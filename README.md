# Handbook for Best Coding Practices

## Coding Standards

### General Programming Practices

It is important to realise that your programming choices will reflect the quality
of your code and impact the productivity levels of your colleagues. Multidots - an agency specialising in web development for content publishers [coding standards guideline](https://www.multidots.com/importance-of-code-quality-and-coding-standard-in-software-development/) highlights the importance of code quality and coding standards to improve efficiency, minimises the risk of project failure, reduces complexity and makes debugging easier.

The following guidelines are recommended to be used as best coding practices when 
working on developement projects:

#### Naming Conventions

Use meaningful variable names throughout your code. Maintain a consistent naming style for classes, functions and files. Names should be explanatory of the object or the functionality of the methods that carry them. 

#### Formatting and Layout

To work together as a team, it is important that each developer effectively formats code, uses auto-lint tools and ensures code is well-segmented and easy to read. 

#### Developement Style

It is encouraged to become familiar with reusable coding patterns and apply them in all developement stages throughout projects. Thiw will reduce the amount of code we have to write and increase team efficiency and allow us (or the company if we wanna give it a name) to maximise its resources. [Perforce's Code Reuse Strategy](https://www.perforce.com/blog/qac/challenge-code-reuse-and-how-reuse-code-effectively)

As a small company we have the ability to reduce code processing times by avoiding overly complex and nested structures which leads to tiple people unnecessarily doing the same job. 

By structuring code 
into logical patterns and focusing on reusability

Avoid over-complex structures and files
Avoid deep-nested structures and large files. Split large files and functions into smaller components. 
Focus on reusable components and functions

For all programming languages refer to general [guidelines](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/code-quality/coding-style/index.html) for coding and formatting styles recommended by the Firefox developement team.
