## **Task Estimation**

### **Work Breakdown Structures**

**WBS** (Work Breakdown Structure) describes what tasks need to be completed in a project. However, it does not include factors such as timelines or resources. The goal of the WBS is to focus the team on what has to be done.

When you're breaking down what has to be done it is important to remove verbs from each level. You are not describing the tasks necessary to complete what has to be done, you are just describing them. Find out more [here](https://www.guru99.com/an-expert-view-on-test-estimation.html )


Some of the benefits of WBS include:
*   **Project Schedule:** Once you define all the tasks required to complete the project, as well as their hierarchical relationships, it will be much easier to assign resources and set deadlines.
*   **Accountability:** Since all elements in a WBS are mutually exclusive, it helps create accountability. A team assigned to a single work package is solely accountable for its completion. This reduces overlaps in responsibility.
*   **Commitment:** The WBS gives teams a very high-level overview of their responsibilities. Since each team is responsible for a specific component at a time, it helps make them more committed to completing their assigned tasks.
*   **Reduces ambiguities:** WBS involves the project manager, team members and relevant stakeholders. This encourages dialog and so everyone knows exactly what they have to do. This way there is ambiguity.

## Coding Standards

### General Programming Practices

It is important to realise that your programming choices will reflect the quality
of your code and impact the productivity levels of your colleagues. 

The following guidelines 
are recommended for best coding practices to be used when working on projects:

#### Naming Conventions

Use meaningful variable names throughout your code. Maintain a consistent naming style for classes, functions and files. Names should be explanatory of the object or the functionality of the methods that carry them. 

#### Formatting and Layout

Code formatting and layout
Code segmentation & indentation for readabilit

#### Developement Style

Avoid over-complex structures and files
Avoid deep-nested structures and large files. Split large files and functions into smaller components. 
Focus on reusable components and functions

For all programming languages refer to general guidelines for coding and formatting style.
