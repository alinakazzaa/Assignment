### Automating the process

Humans are **far** superior to machines in the review code process when it comes to complexity and solving problems. Although humans have a small attention span; therefore, as humans our time is valuable and shouldnâ€™t be wasted on repetitive tasks a machine can do easily.


Additionally, we tend to make more mistakes on repetitive tasks as we lose concertation; some of these tasks include code style. These kinds of tasks can be rather boring. Doing these tasks will take away from valuable time that could be possibly spent on engineering etc. further even after donating time to this there will **still** be errors.

We must offload automatable jobs to machines in the code review process. Repetitive task like code style checking, lining, static code analysis, code complexity calculation, code coverage calculation, execution of tests is the kind of reviews that should be automated. One of the tools I recommend you use is Codecov it is particularly good for code coverage reporting and a CI to integrate everything
