## Evaluate Importance and Priority
#### Prioritization Factors
*	**Financial value of requirements;** Major factor to be considered in prioritizing requirements. The value could be expressed as new revenue, incremental revenue, or as operational efficiency.
*	**Cost of developing requirements;** Essential factor to be considered by the product owner. Value and cost together indicate the Return on Investment (RoI) for the requirements.
*	Amount and **significance of functionality** that will be gained while working on the requirements.
*	Understanding **level of risks** involved in introducing the new features.

#### Prioritization Techniques
Follow the _**relative weighting scheme**_ when trying to prioritise any task. It is a simple model where prioritization is done based on all the factors of the task. Major factors to be considered when weighing prioritization are:
*	The **value of feature** and the negative impact that might be caused by the absence of the feature
*	Based on the collective judgment from product owner and the development team a weight is assigned to each feature in the following way (a scoreboard from 1 to 9 is usually used)
     * Benefit from having the feature 
     * Loss for not having the feature 
     * Cost of producing the feature 
     * The risk incurred in producing the feature
     * The priority and rank are then determined by dividing the value score as below: 
     * (Benefit score + Penalty score) / (Cost score + Risk score)
